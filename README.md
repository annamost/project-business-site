## Tech stack

## Project

The project task was to create a responsive website that head a responsive video/image in the hero section as well as a form with at least three different input types. The website should be responsive for different screensizes. 

I started by designing my idea in Figma. I first decided on a color pallet and then designed a logo. The I designed the page for mobile, tablet and desktop thinking about how the different elements would be affected by bigger screen sizes. 

I then build the skeleton of the website using HTML with a header, main and footer. I created a navigation bar that would turn into a functional hamburger menue in the mobile version. I used different sections to divide up my website including a hero-section with the videos (one for mobile one for desktop/table), two more "content" section to make the website feel more alive, and in the end the section that would include the form. I styled the website using CSS starting with the mobile first approach. After styling the mobile layout, I created a functional hamburger menue using only CSS.  I styled the form using CSS. I used different text-field types (text, email, password) as well as a checkmark and a button. I used HTTPbin with method set to post to validate that I can collect the data input from my form. I then adapted the layout for the different screen sizes. Most of the layout was done using flexbox. In addition, I used relative positions to create a layered effect of the different plant images between the different sections. Lastly, I added some hover effects on the logos. 

Improvement goals: add more input types to the form (e.g. radio buttons)
